Library Management System:
- After a year of learning Java and getting introduced to programming concepts, I created a Library Management System using fundamentals about Object Oriented Programming. 
- Created multiple classes such as a central Library Management System superclass, with User, Staff, Student, AccountInfo, Book, Librarian, and Library Database subclasses.
- Added User Management Methods, allowing them to register accounts, borrow books, calculate fines, and giving them a randomized 6 digit Identification Number
